Speck is a family of lightweight block ciphers publicly released by the National Security Agency. I based my code off of source code found on wikipedia. From the information given I was able to create a decryption function to read encrypted messages. 

## Future Goals: ##
-add this to the jpeg_secret_message repo to allow users to encode secret messages in jpegs using the speck cipher.\n
-implement the algorithm in a generic fashion so that blocksize and message size can be dynamically changes
